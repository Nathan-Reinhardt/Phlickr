# Phlcikr

[Live App](https://phlickr-clone.herokuapp.com/#/)

Phlickr is a photo website where users can interact with photos uploaded by other users onto the site.  The project uses Rails/PostgreSQL backend with React.js and Redux on the frontend.

This project was built and designed witin a 10 day period. I do plan on adding more to the project over time.

### Features

 * Secure backend to frontend with user authentication using BCrypt.
 * Users can only interact with photos when logged in.
 * Photos are displayed all together or when clicked show the individual photo.
 * When a photo is individually picked, it shows the title and description of the photo.

### Possible Future Features

In the future I would like to add on:

 * Fully impliment image uploading of photos for a user with deleting photos owned only by the logged in user.
 * Ability to search for a photo.
 * Have a view count and favorite number for photos.
 * Abiltiy to update a photos information by the owner of the photo.

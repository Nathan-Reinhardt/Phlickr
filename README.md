# Phlickr

[Phlickr](https://phlickr-clone.herokuapp.com/#/) is a pixel perfect replica of Flickr. A tribute to show how precise I can get thier UI and Design.

### Technologies

* Javascript
* HTML
* SCSS
* React/Redux
* Webpack
* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL

### Features

 * Secure backend to frontend with user authentication using BCrypt.
 * Users can only interact with photos when logged in.
 * Photos are displayed all together or when clicked show the individual photo.
 * When a photo is individually picked, it shows the title and description of the photo.

### Possible Future Features

In the future I would like to add on:

 * Fully impliment image uploading of photos for a user with deleting photos owned only by the logged in user.
 * Ability to search for a photo.
 * Have a view count and favorite number for photos.
 * Abiltiy to update a photos information by the owner of the photo.
